# html-ttt
Tic tac toe in static HTML. No JS.

### Running
Run `perl html-ttt-generate.pl --1player` to generate a game's HTML pages. `index.html` is the entry point.

- `--1player` generates a game with an AI opponent that makes random winning moves
- `--2player` generates a game for two humans

### TODO
- Add a flag to make the computer player arbitrary, possibly bad moves
- HTML template could be read from file instead of hardcoded
- Allow output directories to be specified
